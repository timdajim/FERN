Flexible Exploratory Research Node

Very early days, but thought a agentic research flow could be a fun little project that could speed up the trawling though arxiv when trying to look for good research papers at work.
Theres a lot of garbage on arxiv, but if this can find those few great diamonds, then that would be grand.
